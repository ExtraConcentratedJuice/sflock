sflock - simple feedback screen locker
============================ 
Simple screen locker utility for X, based on
slock. Provides a very basic user feedback.   


Requirements
------------
In order to build sflock you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Arch Linux users can install this package from the AUR(http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=44802).

Manual installation:
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (sflock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sflock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running sflock
-------------

Simply invoking the sflock command starts the display locker with default
settings.

Use -f to modify the font, -c to modify the password character, and -h
to toggle the bar.
